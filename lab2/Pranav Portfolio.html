                <p>Hello!,<br> name is Pranav, and I am a 19-year-old engineering student at KR Mangalam University, currently in my first year. I have a naturally curious mindset and a broad range of interests that keep me constantly exploring new fields and ideas. My passions include technology, football, Formula 1, fashion, music, philosophy, content creation, and DJing. <br>

At present, I am learning Python, HTML, and CSS, which are helping me build a strong foundation in programming and web development. I’m especially drawn to the creative side of technology;how logic and design come together to create something impactful. <br>

Music is a big part of my life, with Skrillex being one of my biggest inspirations as a DJ and producer. In sports, Neymar Jr. has played a major role in shaping my love for football and my long-time support for FC Barcelona. I strive to combine my technical skills, creativity, and curiosity to grow as an engineer and create meaningful projects that reflect who I am. <br>
